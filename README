Launcher is a Python application which can display information about other
applications, and can update and launch them.

It must be called from the desired parent folder of the applications to be
launched (i.e., "cd" to the desired directory and then invoke launcher).

For every folder in the current working directory, a tab will be created.

On those tabs :

  If a file named "README" exists, it will be displayed.

  It looks for a file called "FILES.txt" which contains the expected files,
  and their MD5 hash. If the MD5 hash calculated does not match, the expected
  value will be displayed in square brackets after the file-value. This can
  be used to update "FILES.txt" to match changes made to any file.

  A "Launch" button will attempt to run the script indicated by the *first*
  'valid' line in "FILES.txt". It does not matter if the MD5 is correct or not.
  A line in FILES.txt is 'valid' if there are two stings there (normally, the
  filename and the MD5 value); this program is dumb, so ANY two strings on a
  single line will cause that line to be considered 'valid'. GIGO.

[TODO] Will have the capability to update the application files from its github
repository, later. Add button (greyed, if up-to-date already?).

[TODO] Future versions should allow selection of the desired parent folder;
delete any old tabs and create new ones, when this occurs. Can this program
simply launch a copy of itself in the new folder, and terminate it old self?
