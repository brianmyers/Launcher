Launcher is a Python application which can display information about other
applications, and can update and launch them.

It must be called from the desired parent folder of the applications to be
launched (i.e., "cd" to the desired directory and then invoke launcher).

For every folder in the current working directory, a tab will be created.

On those tabs :

  If a file named "README" exists, it will be displayed.

  It looks for a file called "FILES.txt" which contains the expected files,
  and their MD5 hash. If the MD5 hash calculated does not match, it will display
  the expected value in square brackets (which can used to update "FILES.txt").

[TODO] Add button to launch the first file in "FILES.txt", assuming it is a Python
script file.

[TODO] Will have the capability to update the application files from its github
repository, later. Add button (greyed, if up-to-date already?).

[TODO] Future versions should allow selection of the desired parent folder;
delete any old tabs and create new ones, when this occurs. Can this program
simply launch a copy of itself in the new folder, and terminate it old self?
